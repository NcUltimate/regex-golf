Regex Golf
-----------

A rails app inspired by a blog post by Peter Norvig. Visit at http://regex-golf.herokuapp.com.

Use regular expressions to match all of the words in the list on the left, but none of the words in the list on the right.

Generating regular expressions to match a list of words is an example of the Set Cover problem, which is np-complete. Norvig's implementation (and my own) use greedy approximation algorithms, which first generate a list of possible regular expressions, then iteratively pick the shortest expression that matches the most words until all words are covered. This could result in a suboptimal solution, and in some cases multiple solutions are also obviously possible.
